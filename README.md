# Project Title: MedTrack

## Description
MedTrack is a comprehensive inventory management system designed to streamline the distribution process of pharmaceutical products. It facilitates seamless communication between distributors and salespersons, ensuring efficient tracking of medicine stock and generating invoices and receipts for client transactions.

- **Transaction Management:** It enables distributors to record sales transactions, generate invoices, and issue receipts seamlessly.
- **User Authentication:** JWT authentication ensures secure access to the system, allowing authorized users to perform specific actions based on their roles.
- **Real-time Updates:** With Redis as a background worker, MedTrack provides real-time updates on inventory levels and transaction status.
- **Scalability and Deployment:** Deployed using Docker on Railways, MedTrack is highly scalable and can be easily deployed across different environments.
